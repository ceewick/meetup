This is a scraper to pull a member list from meetup.com. Will put members into a CSV. 

Note: 
1) You need to update username and password. 
2) You will need to update the offset in urls... going to the last page, find offset, update in the while loop.

The 'output.csv' doesn't have ALL members because I didn't have time (at the time) to scrape all
